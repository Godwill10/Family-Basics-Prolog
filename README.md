**Prolog Project FamilyBasics**

**Name: Godwill Afolabi**

**Purpose**

This Prolog program defines a family tree using facts and rules. The program consists of two files: family_facts.pl and family_rules.pl. The family_facts.pl file contains the facts about the family members, such as their parents, gender, and marital status. The family_rules.pl file contains the rules that can be used to answer questions about the family relationships, such as who is someone's grandparent, sibling, or cousin.

The program also includes a questions.pl file that contains sample queries that can be used to test the rules and facts. These queries include questions such as who someone's ancestors are, who someone's nieces and nephews are, and who someone's siblings are.
